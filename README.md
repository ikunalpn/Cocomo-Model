# COCOMO Model Estimation Webpage

This project aims to provide a simple webpage for estimating software project effort and cost using the COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) estimation model. The webpage allows users to select a COCOMO model type (Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced), input project details, and receive estimates for effort and cost.

## Getting Started

To run the COCOMO estimation webpage locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the project directory:

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Choose a COCOMO model by selecting the appropriate radio button (Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced).

2. Enter the project size in KLOC (Kilo Lines of Code) in the input field provided.

3. Click the "Calculate" button.

4. The estimated effort in person-months and the estimated cost in USD will be displayed.

## Disclaimer

This is a simplified example and should not be used for actual project planning. Actual COCOMO calculations involve more complex parameters and coefficients. Consult with experts in software estimation and development for accurate project planning.
